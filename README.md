# MyApps

MyApps is an offline-first organization tool with infinite UI. It features P2P syncing across your devices and between your friends.

You can spawn any number of "Apps" inside it to start using it. Currently three Apps are implemeted: An image reference board, A text writing app and a link app.

- Image reference app: Drag and drop images from the internet or from your file browser. Organize the images in Image Reference App and use this board for your next 2D/3D creativity project.
- Text App: Write texts, take notes, prepare to-do lists with checkboxes.
- Link App: Paste a URL in this app and now you have a link to that URL! Create bunch of Link Apps and enter your favorites URLs. Now you have a start-up page, like New Tab in Chrome or Firefox. But it's on streoids!

Do you have an app idea that you would like to see here? Go ahead and contribute!
